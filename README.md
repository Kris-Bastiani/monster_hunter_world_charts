# Monster Hunter World Weakness Chart

A small project for fun using monster weakness info from 'Monster Hunter World' to play with some basic data presentation.

Based off the `OrchidAugur/boiler__gulp_webpack` boilerplate.

## Getting Started

Simply run `yarn` from within the project directory.

## Development

Webpack is run via Gulp, so there should be no need to run that directly.

To build in development mode, run `gulp build`.

To start a local server on port 3000 with livereload enabled, run `gulp`.

## Production

To build in production mode, run `npm run build:prod`.
